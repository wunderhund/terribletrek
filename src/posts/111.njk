description: "The fans who were upset about the notion of families onboard this new Enterprise got their due when several of the crew's children, including Wesley, are spirited off the ship to help a genetically poisoned society eventually introduce fresh new DNA. Spolier alert! The magical power source that sustains the colony's lives is also the thing that was killing them! Who could have seen THAT coming? \"When the Bough Breaks\" is yet another lazy plot that any Trek fan could have spotted a mile away. Remember the key rule in Hollywood: never work with animals or children."
