description: "A behind-schedule teraforming mission on Velara III draws the Enterprise to investigate, whereupon they discover a new crystalline form of life living in the \"Home Soil,\" which, incidentally, is not the first crystaline life form encountered by this crew. If I had a nickle for every time this happens, I'd have 15 cents, which isn't a lot, but it's odd that it's happened more than once! There's some solid sci-fi present, but it gets bogged down thanks to the rushed delivery of the screenplay, and issues with sets and casting."
